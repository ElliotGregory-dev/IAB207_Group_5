# IAB207_Group_5
I merged the branch because index.html page wasn't viewable. I was then trying stuff out and reverted the merge which kind of made things out of wack,
but I then 'reverted the revert' therefore making it redundant. 
Basically the only change is the re-added index.html page because it wasn't viewable for somereason. - Brandon
